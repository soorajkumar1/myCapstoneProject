# Dog vs Cat Classification Using CNN for Deep Learning and Machine Learning Course

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Python to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras and achieves accurate predictions on unseen images.

# Overview

The objective of this project is to classify images as either a dog or a cat. The dataset consists of labeled images of dogs and cats, split into training, validation, and testing sets. The CNN model is trained and tested on this dataset to achieve robust predictions.

# Features
	•	Preprocessing images using data augmentation techniques.
	•	Custom CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras.
	•	Visualization of training and validation accuracy/loss.
	•	Classification of new images in a single_prediction folder.

# Dataset

The dataset includes:
	•	Training set: 4000 images of dogs and 4000 images of cats.
	•	Testing set: 1000 images of dogs and 1000 images of cats.

# Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
	1.	Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling.
	2.	Dropout layers for regularization.
	3.	Fully connected Dense layers with Softmax for classification.


# Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:

	•	pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

# Acknowledgments
	•	Dataset sourced from Kaggle’s Dogs vs Cats.
	•	TensorFlow and Keras for providing robust machine learning tools.
